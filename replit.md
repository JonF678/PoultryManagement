# Poultry Management System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Progressive Web Application (PWA) for managing poultry farms. The system provides offline-capable functionality for tracking production cycles, managing cages, logging production data, and analyzing performance metrics. Built as a client-side application with local data storage, it's designed to work reliably even without internet connectivity.
